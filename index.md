Hello, thanks for swinging by!

### a bit on me

<p>
  <div id="animation" style="color: green">
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    const movingString = "Collen"
    const distance = 20
    let spaces = 0
    let step = 1
    const animationElement = document.getElementById("animation")
    setInterval(() => {
      animationElement.innerHTML = "[" + "&nbsp;".repeat(spaces) + movingString + "&nbsp;".repeat(distance - spaces - movingString.length) + "]"
      spaces += step
      if (spaces === 0 || (spaces + movingString.length) === distance) {
        step = -step
      }
    }, 50)
  </script>

If you're here it's likely to checkout my portfolio of things I've worked on. If you want to see my papers, head to the bottom, I normally update it when I can. 

### current research interests

- Conversational AI
- Dialogue State Tracking
- Natural Language Understanding

### code

I like to code - Moral of the story like most engineers - I love solving puzzles in my free time. I'm a full stack developer, that means I do everything from requirement gathering and design to development, transition, and sustainment. Here's my primary languages and tools I use.

Languages: Python, Swift, Java, JS, C++, Bash

Tools: Docker, AWS, Solr, Mongo, Postgres, SQL, JIRA, Kubernetes, Sketch, Figma

Here's some of the open projects I've worked on.

#### flydenity - [Checkout the Code](https://github.com/Collen-Roller/flydenity)

Flydenity is a callsign identification library to help match tail numbers or callsigns to origin nations. The library is a python wrapper on top of a curated dataset containing a set of regular expressions generated from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) International Call Sign prefixes. The registration codes in this dataset are separated by country post The Paris Convention in 1929. The database also contains a description of each codeset with 2 and 3 letter ISO country codes following the ISO-3166 standard.

#### rasa denerator - [Checkout the Code](https://github.com/Collen-Roller/Rasa-Denerator)

A simple way of generating a domain.yml file for the Rasa conversational AI framework

#### anc control - [Checkout the App](https://fnd.io/#/us/ipad-app/1518858229-anc-control-by-michael-manno)

A IOS iPad television control application used by The Standard Athens hotels. I developed the full-stack application and published it in mid-2020

#### shameless plug

I enjoy full-stack Swift / Python development so if you're looking for a developer, please feel free to reachout.

In my spare time, sometime I like making music and posting it. I like making videos so more recently I've been posting covers of songs to YouTube.

I've been playing guitar, keys, and a variety of other instruments for the better part of 15 years now. I'm in two bands currently and I have some music I produced with friends back in high-school that people still enjoy.
